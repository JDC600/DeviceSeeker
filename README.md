Scan devices that you have in your network.


One thing to keep in mind is that you have have to change a line of code in the section " | Select-String dinámico | ", instead of "dinámico" you have to put dynamic if you have your powershell in english, or if you have another language you have to change that word in your respective language.

I will automate that process in the future.
